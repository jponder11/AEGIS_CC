# AEGIS_CC Conventions

- Preserve the top-level layout: `docs/`, `db/`, `core/`, `ui/`, `README.md`.
- Keep domain documentation in `docs/domain/` and operational rules in `docs/rules/`.
- Store database migrations in `db/migrations/` and seed data in `db/seed/`.
- Place backend/service logic under `core/`; each project lives in `core/projects/<project>/`.
- Place frontend/UI work under `ui/`; each project lives in `ui/projects/<project>/`.
- Avoid adding new top-level folders without updating `README.md` and this rule.
